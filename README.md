    "Interactive dashboard for visualizing supermarket sales data, analyzing profit, discounts, and product performance.\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "This project uses Plotly Dash to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes supermarket sales data, focusing on profit, discount impact, and regional variations. The goal is to analyze how different product sub-categories perform in terms of sales and profit, and explore how discounts affect profitability across regions and customer segments.\n",

    "## Features\n",
    "- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize supermarket sales data with interactive plots.\n",
    "- **Segment Filtering**: Filter data by customer segment (e.g., Corporate, Consumer, Home Office).\n",
    "- **Profit Analysis**: Identify sub-categories with negative profit and explore discount impact.\n",
    "- **Discount Analysis**: View how discount percentages affect profitability for each product sub-category.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies Used\n",
    "- **Dash**: Framework for building the interactive dashboard.\n",
    "- **Plotly**: Visualization library for creating interactive plots.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- **Python**: Core programming language used.\n",

    "## Results Summary\n",
    "* High-sales sub-categories (e.g., Phones, Chairs) donâ€™t always yield high profits.\n",
    "* Copiers showed strong profits despite lower sales volume.\n",
    "* Supplies, Bookcases, and Tables often led to losses due to heavy discounting.\n",
    "* The Consumer segment generally produces more profit than Corporate and Home Office.\n",
